# CF_DDNS
Small Typescript code which updates Cloudflare DNS records as configured in environment variable using the public IPv4 address of the local machine.

# Environment Variables
Environment file if defined must be present 
There are some environment variables which need to be defined before running the script for an successful update :
* Mandatory :
  1. **CF_API_TOKEN** = Cloudflare API token generated by the user.
  2. **DOMAIN** = The domain name along with the TLD without any leading subdomain names. Example : *example.com*

* Optional : 
  1. **SUBDOMAIN** = Subdomain to be appended along with the **DOMAIN** environment variable.   
  Example : if SUBDOMAIN = "eg1" along with DOMAIN = "example.com" is configured in the environment variables, then the resolved DNS name whose IPv4 will be created/updated will be *eg1.example.com*

# Dependencies
Preferred runtime is **Bun**. The project was initialized in **Bun**.
